_This is an early DRAFT_

== Introduction

I'm not an expert on the topic of "control theory", "adaptive control", "self-adaptive systems", "PID controller", "queueing theory", etc.
Therefor the terms I use here may be wrong or not exactly right. If you are an expert on one or more of these topics,
please feel free to fork this repo and send me a pull request with fixes for the wording. I'll help you with the tool setup if necessary.

I'm a software engineer from Switzerland with 14 years hands-on experience.
I work most of the time as an external consultant in the "business software" area, doing some opensource-development/education/community-stuff in my "free time".

=== The story

The team-leader of the team where I work at the moment has a background in electrical engineering.
For him, it's totally clear that we have "feedback control" like systems using controllers, sensors *everywhere*.
These "things" give you "cruise control" in your car, a constant temperature in your room, a hearing aid device in your ear which adopts to the sound-level
or a self-flying plane with two dormant pilots.

You certainly noticed, that when you are driving your car and using the "cruise control" feature of it, the car goes at
constant speed, e.g. 55 mph. If the road climbs, the car doesn't slow down, the "cruise control system" let the engine work a little bit harder to keep the pace.
Same for the newer "adaptive cruise control" feature, where the speed of the car in front of you is measured and your car
reacts on it, too. So you drive only 55 mph if there is no car in front of you or if it's faster than 55 mph,
otherwise you have the same speed as the car in front of you. That's cool!

*But why did I never see something like this in the design of a software system?*

For example in a batch program, where the number of workers (threads) is dependent on the average CPU load of the system it's working on?
We want to go "fullspeed", but not to go into the "red zone" (100% CPU or swapping memory). And not to slow. E.g. our batch program should use 85%-90% of the CPU power
(or memory, or ...). The problem here is, that each piece of work that the workers (threads) do, is not very deterministic
(because of if/else, strategies, calls to other systems, ... everywhere in the sourcecode).

Or another example would be the maximum size of a queue (array, buffer, ...). If you don't know the size in bytes of each element which will be soon in the queue, but you have a limited amount of memory,
e.g. 8 GB RAM, what's then the max number of elements of the queue? If you make it unbounded or too large, you risk an OutOfMemoryError (Crash).
If you make it too small, you are not using all your hardware. Of course, you do try and error with
some kind of configurable values to figure out the "best settings", but you probably have to do that for each kind of different box (8 GB, 4 GB, 16 GB, ...),
where always exactly the same piece of software runs. Think of a software vendor shipping his 400-kb-jar program to thousands
of different customers using different old and new macbooks, desktops, rasperry-pis, etc. That's either a lot of work to create
different "default" configurations, kind of an if/else-hell in the sourcecode or just a suboptimal configuration.

Recently I found the call of William Louth for a "self-adaptive manifesto" footnote:[see first comment of http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/08/reactive-programming-emerging] which made me start thinking.

== My motivation of appyling adaptive control in software systems

=== Throtteling the pace

I currently work in test-automation for software systems. The test-automation system operates a "system under test" (a black box) like a puppet.
(Think of a GUI roboter opening up the GUI of the "system under test" and clicking thru its menues, wizards, forms, ect.)

The problem here is, that we want to have as quickly as possible the results of the thousands of functional tests you have written,
but on a "system under test" working in the "green zone", not in the "red zone". It's not load-testing and it's not over-load testing,
where it probably behaves different (strange). You do functional testing where you expect 1+1=2, even with 100% CPU load and swapping OS.

The question for us now is, *how many tests can we execute in parallel without "pushing to hard"*.
By now, we do it by manually controlling the number of workers in parallel (threads) and having an eye on the Ganglia footnoe:[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglia_(software)] webclient to check the load.
With a little experience, you know pretty soon that the "system under test" instance X can deal with 5 workers,
and the instance Y with 8, etc. An additional problem here is, that you are not alone on some of these boxes or that some of the boxes do not have a constant number of CPU cores... They are virtual boxes.
At night, you can go with 10 workers for example, during the day only with 5.
But you don't want to sit nearby all the time and do the adjustment of the number of parallel workers by hand.
Or to buy additional hardware boxes, where "you are alone" and with constant CPU power.

We want cruise control!

=== Surviving

On the other side is the "system under test" (think of e.g. a webapplication), which should run as stable as possible
and deliver the quality of service it's clients expect. And if it can't, it's better to reduce the quality of service a little bit
(e.g. reduce resolution of a streaming video service from 1080p to 720p) than to "go down" (crash) or "don't reply".
See the point? The "system under test" has different strategies to deal with "overload":
"crashing", "reducing qos", "only serving some of the clients" (e.g. serve the logged-in-clients and deny the new clients who want to log-in),
some kind of backpressure, etc.

In the case of choosing "reducing qos". Wouldn't it be nice to have an adaptive controller, which automatically reduces
the delivered video resolution if the load is "to much"? That's not great, but better than crashing/not responding/strange behavioring.

Cruise control, again!

== Experiments

In this little github-opensource-project I'll do some experiments. Interested people can open some small little Java application with a GUI,
configure some parameters and let it run. You'll have some monitors and graphs to see the behaviour of the system.
You can experiment with different controllers, with different kind of deterministic or non-deterministic load,
changing the settings, the number of workers, etc

=== Experiment 1: Adapting size of thread-pool with very simple controller and deterministic load

==== Setup

* 1 standalone application
* a Runnable implementation for the "workers" (threads) which produces a constant CPU load (e.g. generate UUID's, ...)
* a dynamic thread-pool (workers)
* a sensor which delivers the systems CPU load
* a very simple controller with a chooseable target level for CPU load, e.g. 80% and a simple behavior: increase the number of threads (workers) if below target level, decrease the number of threads (workers) if above target level
* a host computer which is idling and doing nothing else (you are "alone" on it)

TODO illustration

==== Expectation

===== Swinging

* After starting, the controller should increase the number of threads (workers) to a "good level" and the CPU load is at around 80%. *good!*
* But then it will decrease the number of workers by 1 (or n), then increase it by 1 (or n), then decrease, increase, ... The system will "swing". *bad* if it is swinging heavily (0..9..0..9..), not bad if it's swinging only a little (7..8..7..8..)

===== Reacting to external disturbance

* If there is another process on the same host computer starting and consuming a lot of CPU power at a *constant* level, "our" process will throttle it's numbers of workers and reduce it's CPU usage. Somehow *good* in terms of not overloading the computer and being fair.

=== Experiment 2: Adapting size of thread-pool with a PID controller

==== Setup

Same as 1, but with a better controller. A PID controller footnote:[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller], which is widely used today in home automation, cars, ...

==== Expectation

Same as 1, but no swinging (or little swinging).

=== Experiment 3, 4, 5, ...

Regarding adaptive thread-pool sizes

* Payload of workers not deterministic (internal disturbance)
* CPU load of external process varying (external disturbance)
* A second source to control a level: Amount of free (or used) memory
* A more advanced controller using MRAC/MIAC footnote:[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_control]
* ...


Regarding adaptive queue sizes

* Maximum queue size depending on free memory with blocking backpressure
* Maximum queue size depending on free memory with rejecting new elements
* ...

Regarding adaptive quality of service

* ...

Regarding load-balancing

* ...

This is work in progress. Thanks for your feedback.
