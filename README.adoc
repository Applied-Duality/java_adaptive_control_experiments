_This is an early DRAFT_

== Introduction

I'm not an expert on the topic of "control theory", "adaptive control", "self-adaptive systems", "PID controller", "queueing theory", etc.
Therefor the terms I use here may be wrong or not exactly right. If you are an expert on one or more of these topics,
please feel free to fork this repo and send me a pull request with fixes for the wording. I'll help you with the tool setup if necessary.

I'm a software engineer from Switzerland with 14 years hands-on experience.
I work most of the time as an external consultant, doing some opensource-development/education/community-stuff in my "free time".

=== The story

The team-leader of the team where I work at the moment has a background in electrical engineering.
For him, it's totally clear that we have "feedback control" like systems using controllers, sensors *everywhere*.
These "things" give you "cruise control" in your car, a constant temperature in your room
or a self-flying plane with two dormant pilots.

You certainly noticed, that when you are driving your car and using the "cruise control" feature of it, the car goes at
constant speed, e.g. 55 mph. If the road climbs, the car doesn't slow down, the "cruise control system" let the engine work a little bit harder to keep the pace.
Same for the newer "adaptive cruise control" feature, where the speed of the car in front of you is measured and your car
reacts on it, too. So you drive only 55 mph if there is no car in front of you or if it's faster than 55 mph,
otherwise you have the same speed as the car in front of you. That's cool!

*But why did I never see something like this in the design of a software system?*

For example in a batch program, where the number of workers (threads) is dependent on the average CPU load of the system it's working on?
We want to go "fullspeed", but not go into the red area. And not to slow. E.g. our batch program should use 85%-90% of the CPU power
(or memory, or ...). The problem here is, that each piece of work that the workers (threads) do, is not very deterministic
(because of if/else, strategies, calls to other systems, ... everywhere in the sourcecode).

Or another example would be the maximum size of a queue (array, buffer, ...). If you don't know the size of the elements which will be soon in the queue, but you have "only"
8 GB RAM, what's then the max number of elements of the queue? If you make it unbounded or too large, you risk an OutOfMemoryError (Crash).
If you make it too small, you are not using all your hardware. Of course, you do try and error with
some kind of configurable values to figure out the "best settings", but you probably have to do that for each kind of different box (8 GB, 4 GB, 16 GB, ...),
where always exactly the same piece of software runs. Think of a software vendor shipping his 400-kb-jar program to thousands
of different customers using different old and new macbooks, desktops, rasperry-pis, etc. That's either a lot of work to create
different "default" configurations, kind of an if/else-hell in the sourcecode or just a suboptimal configuration.


== Motivation

I currently work in test-automation for software systems. The test-automation system operates a "system under test" (a black box) like a puppet.
(Think of a GUI roboter opening up the GUI of the "system under test" and clicking thru its menues, wizards, forms, ect.)

The problem here is, that you want to have as quickly as possible the results of the thousands of functional tests you have written,
but on a "system under test" working in the "green area", not in the "red area". It's not load-testing or over-load testing,
where it probably behaves different (strange). You do functional testing where you expect 1+1=2, even with 100% CPU load and swapping OS.

The question for us now is, *how many tests can we execute in parallel without "pushing to hard"*.
By now, we do it by manually controlling the number of workers in parallel (threads) and having an eye on the Ganglia webclient to check the load.
With a little experience, you know pretty soon that the "system under test" instance X can deal with 5 workers,
and the instance Y with 8, etc. An additional problem here is, that you are not alone on some of these boxes or that some of the boxes do not have a constant number of CPU cores... They are virtual boxes.
At night, you can go with 10 workers for example, during the day only with 5.
But you don't want to sit nearby all the time and do the adjustment of the number of parallel workers by hand.
Or to buy additional hardware boxes, where "you are alone" and with constant CPU power.

We want cruise control!

== Experiments

In this little github-opensource-project I'll do some experiments. You'll open some small little Java application with a GUI,
configure some parameters and let it run. You'll have some monitors and graphs to see the behaviour of the system.
You can experiment then with different controllers, with different kind of deterministic or non-deterministic load,
number of workers, etc

=== Experiment 1: Thread-Pool size with very simple controller and deterministic load

==== Setup

* 1 standalone application
* a Runnable implementation for the "workers" (threads) which produces a constant CPU load
* a dynamic thread-pool (workers)
* a sensor which delivers the systems CPU load
* a very simple controller with an upper and lower bound, which should bring the number of threads of the thread-pool (workers) to a level, where the CPU load is 80%
* a host computer which is idling and doing nothing else

TODO illustration

==== Expectation

===== Swinging

* After starting, the controller should increase the number of workers to a "good level" and the CPU load is at 80%. *good!*
* But then it will decrease the number of workers by 1 (or n), then increase it by 1 (or n), then decrease, increase, ... The system will "swing". *bad*.

===== Reacting to external disturbance

* If there is another process starting and consuming a lot of CPU power at a *constant* level, "our" process will throttle it's numbers of workers. Somehow *good* in terms of not overloading the computer.

=== Experiment 2: Thread-Pool size with a PID controller

==== Setup

Same as 1, but with a better controller. A PID controller, which is widely used today.

==== Expectation

Same as 1, but no swinging.

=== Experiment 3, 4, 5, ...

Regarding thread-pool sizes

* Payload of workers not deterministic (internal disturbance)
* CPU load of external process varying (external disturbance)
* A second source a control: Amount of free memory
* ...


Regarding queue sizes

* Maximum queue size depending on free memory with blocking backpressure
* Maximum queue size depending on free memory with rejecting new elements
* ...

== Summary

This is work in progress. Thanks for your feedback.
